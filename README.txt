Ride-my-way.

Ride-my-way is about connecting drivers with passengers 
in realtime in a very effecient manner. 
It starts by creating an account as either 
a driver or a passenger. Once done
 you will be able to setup ride offers 
for the case of drivrs and
 to receive notifications for the case of passengers. 
Passengers can make request to any available ride offers
and drivers can accept or reject the requests.
    
Ride-my-way is important in the following ways:

To passengers.
  Passengers are saved from unnecessary 
waiting faced when one is not certain of the ride to go with.
  They have a long list of choices 
to choose from hence can choose the best price for them.
  passengers can leverage the benefit 
of timely notification and plane their travels wisely.
To drivers
  Drvers are connected to a wide range of market
 thus good business for them.
  They save a lot of time if the get to accept request
 to their offers in time.
  Drivers are saved from the traditional
 rudimentary way of looking for passengers along the drive route. 
Getting started with the project:
 All you need is your computer with a browser and internet connection.

and leverage of a very huge network.
